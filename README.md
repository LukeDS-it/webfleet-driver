![build](https://github.com/LukeDS-it/webfleet-driver/workflows/build/badge.svg)

This microservice is part of Webfleet, a new distributed cms.

# Building

To build, run `sbt build`

# Running locally

To run locally, first of all start the `docker-compose.yml` in the `environment` directory,
it will provide all the needed dependencies.

You will then need to set the correct environment variables, and then run `sbt run`

# Running on Docker

A docker container will soon be available.
